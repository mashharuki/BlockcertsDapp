## This is a hack
[Redux Logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger) is a nice utility enabling the logging of redux events.

Unfortunately in the context of Polymer, we can't seem to be able to resolve a normal `import` (as the exposed library does not provide ES modules export when compiled), nor use requirejs as a dependency to manage the require of commonjs module.

`Polymer serve` does not compile on the fly (?), so for us to be able to implement redux-logger in our code, we copied the source into our codebase.

Similarly, we had to copy the dependency from [deep-diff](https://github.com/flitbit/diff) for redux-logger to work.

TODO: implement a webpack build to not depend on `polymer serve` and replace this code by the normal dependency management for redux-logger.
